# FHIR Lesson 11: Working with FHIR Resources Using Python

This repository contains educational materials and example code for **Lesson 11** of the *Vanderbilt Local FHIR Training* series. The lesson is focused on using the [`fhir.resources`](https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhir.resources) Python library to work with HL7Â® FHIRÂ® data formats in JSON, specifically to parse, validate, and construct FHIR resource objects in Python.

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. âœ… Understand how to install and use the `fhir.resources` Python library.
2. ðŸ“¥ Parse (unmarshal) JSON-encoded FHIR data into FHIR resource objects.
3. ðŸ“¤ Construct (marshal) FHIR resource objects into JSON for posting to a server.
4. ðŸ§° Practice basic object-oriented programming patterns for working with FHIR resource classes.

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup

To isolate your dependencies and avoid package conflicts, create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate it (Windows)
myenv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source myenv/bin/activate

from fhir.resources.patient import Patient
import json

with open("example_patient.json") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

patient = Patient(**data)
print(patient.name[0].family)
